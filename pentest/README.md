# Penetration Test Planning

## Deliverables

* Documentation of target system
* Detailed test plan including both static and dynamic tests
* Example of tool setup for target system and planned tests
* Test report for dynamic testing
* Description of static tests and results
* Description of possible mitigations for any issues found

Ideally, these would be added as a set of appendices to the "WoT Security Testing Plan" document.
We can however use MD files here and then after the testing is done these can be consolidated and converted to HTML to add to an appendix.

## Prerequisites

Task do to prior to "test day":
* Documentation for the system under test (target system) - McCool, ASAP
* Testers need access to systems with access to private network with access to systems under test.
    - Cloud system: access to proxy endpoint from "inside" cloud server (simulating network access)
    - LAN Server: access to server on local LAN; VNC supported
    - "Access" to include: accounts, SSH access, and sudo rights, ip forwarding, VNC

## Tests (Detailed Plan)

Will focus on dynamic weakness testing:
* Fuzz testing of HTTP devices and services
* Fuzz testing of CoAP things
* Vulnerability scanning of target
