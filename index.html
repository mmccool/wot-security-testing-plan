    <section>
      <h1>Adversarial Security Testing</h1>

      <p>Adversarial security testing (or pentesting) includes various checks that can be done in order
      to find vulnerabilities in the target device or service and determine their
      severity and exploitability.
      On a high level any penetration testing consists of three stages:
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Information gathering</strong>, where required information is collected about the attack target
          <li><strong>Vulnerability discovering</strong>, where an attack target is analyzed and applicable
          vulnerabilities found, and finally
          <li><strong>Exploitation attempt</strong>, where the found vulnerabilities
          are attempted to be exploited to achieve of the desired outcome, such as privilege
          escalation, authorization bypass, denial of service and others.
      </ul>
      In turn, the stage two can be done in one (or combination) of the following activities:
      static vulnerability discovery and runtime vulnerability discovery.</p>

      <p>Many resources and tools exist to help penetration and security testers to
      perform the above activities, as well as many documents and tutorials written
      to help guiding this activity. One example of such guide is the "Web Service
      Security Testing Cheat Sheet" [[Owa18]] written by the Open Web Application
      Security Project.</p>

    <section id="static-vulnerability-discovery">
    <h2>Static Vulnerability Discovery</h2>

      <p>This activity typically requires an access to the target's source code,
      and therefore is not always possible to perform for a penetration tester.
      However, since a WoT Thing developer or WoT Service provider have the access,
      they are strongly encouraged to use the below methods to check potential
      vulnerabilities in their components. Static vulnerability discovery is very common
      and well automated with many existing tools, so after an initial setup phase,
      it should provide little overhead to the WoT component development and release process.
      </p>

      <section id="static-code-analysis">
      <h3>Static Code Analysis</h3>

      <p>The most common example of static vulnerability discovery is usage of a
      static code analyzer tool that is able to parse the programming code and
      highlight potential development mistakes, such usage of insecure function or types,
      forgotten boundary checking when operating on arrays and many others.
      Usually the output of this tool is a result of a code scan in a form of a report that
      needs to be manually triaged to determine if each reported case is a false positive
      or a real mistake. While static development tools are constantly improving and able
      to offer better coverage, lower false positive rating and discover more potentially
      vulnerable places, it is important to remember that these tools (as any others) do
      not guarantee finding all vulnerable places in the scanned component, so other methods
      should be used to complement it.</p>

	    <p><strong>Examples of tools</strong>:
      Many commercial and open source tools exist that primary differ on the
      source code language that they can process as input. The major suggestion
      would be to choose a well-established, mature tool that is actively
      supported and developed. Some examples include Klocwork [[Klocwork]],
      Coverity [[Coverity]], Checkmarx [[Checkmarx]], etc.
      Also, while some of these tools are commercial and require a license
      to use, they do provide a free scanning service for open source projects.
      One example of such service is an online Coverity service [[CoverityOnline]]
      </p>
      </section>

      <section id="known-vulnerability-checking">
	    <h3>Known vulnerability checking</h3>

      <p>In addition to checking for development mistakes in produced program code,
      it is important to check that the resulting component does not include
      vulnerable 3rd party libraries or utilities. There are many tools developed
      for this purpose and on a high-level they work by scanning executable binary
      (or source code for non-compiled languages) or application package in a search
      of vulnerable components, such as old versions of libraries that are vulnerable
      to known attacks. The information about vulnerabilities usually comes from
      the open NIST database and usually updated regularly (daily or more often), since
      new vulnerabilities are reported all the time.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Examples of tools</strong>:
      Same as with static code analyzer software, the major suggestion
      would be to choose a well-established, mature tool that is actively
      supported and developed. Some examples include Protecode[[Protecode]],
      Dependency-check [[OWASP-Dependency-Check]], Snyk [[Snyk]], etc.
      etc.
      </p>
      </section>
    </section>


    <section id="runtime-vulnerability-discovery">
	  <h2>Runtime (Dynamic) Vulnerability Discovery</h2>

      <p>In contrast to the Static Vulnerability Discovery, the runtime
      vulnerability discovery does not require access to the source code or
      compiled binaries of a component, but merely an ability to access
      component's exposed interfaces (especially network-facing interfaces)
      or an ability to observe and modify the protocol communication.
      The goal of such discovery is to find an interface input or protocol
      modification, that leads to unintended behavior, such as component
      deadlock, crash, etc.
      Similarly as for static vulnerability discovery, many tools exists to
      help with this task, however, it is generally a bit harder to reach full
      automation (with exception of fuzz testing) here, and the best results
      can be archive by combining both manual and automated tasks.
      </p>

      <section id="fuzz-testing">
	    <h3>Fuzz Testing</h3>

      <p>Fuzz testing is one of the most known and used runtime vulnerability
      discovery methods. It is well-automated, many tools exists for common
      protocols and payloads, and it is a very powerful method for vulnerability
      discovery.
      Fuzz testing works by generating (randomly or pattern-based) highly
      varied input for a certain network exposed interface or protocol payload,
      sending this input to the tested component and observing the result.
      If a desired outcome happens (such as tested component crashes), the
      corresponding input and details of the crash are recorded for the
      analyst to manually process.</p>

      <p>The biggest challenge with the fuzz testing is usually to be able to
      generate the fuzzed input in a correct form that it does not get
      discarded by the lower layers of software or network stack. For example,
      if the fuzz testing goal is to test how a WoT Thing instance processes
      numeric values on its temperature setting HTTP-exposed interface,
      it is important that fuzzed requests have valid HTTP headers, body
      structure, etc. This way the requests will get delivered all the way
      to the WoT Thing instance and not discarded by HTTP message validation
      and processing components.</p>

	    <p><strong>Examples of tools</strong>: There are numerous tools exists for fuzzing
      HTTP(S)-exposed interfaces, such as Burp Suite[[Burp]], Wfuzz[[Wfuzz]],
      Wapiti [[wapiti]] and others.
      Newer protocols, like COAP(S), have considerably less tools
      available, such as fuzzcoap [[FuzzCoAP]] or CoAP Peach Pit (from Peach Fuzzer)
      [[PeachPit-COAP]], and some of them can be still in the experimental phase.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="protocol-analysis">
	    <h3>Protocol Analysis</h3>

      In addition to the automated Fuzz testing, one might be able to discover
      vulnerabilities by manually analyzing the protocol elements, such as
      headers, payload, attributes and others. While the actual analysis happens
      manually, many tools exist to capture the protocol traffic, parse it
      according to the protocol and present to the analyst in an organized fashion.

      <p><strong>Examples of tools</strong>: Classical examples of network protocol
      analyzers are Wireshark [[Wireshark]], tcpdump [[tcpdump]] and others. </p>
      </section>

      <section id="vulnerability-scanners">
	    <h3>Vulnerability scanners</h3>
	    <p>There are many tools available that attempt to perform a runtime
      testing for known vulnerabilities. They usually operate
      by attempting to run a known set of exploits against the target and report
      the outcome. Such tools should be used in addition to the fuzz testing tools
      in order to get a more complete runtime vulnerability discovery.
	    </p>

      <p><strong>Examples of tools</strong>: While many different vulnerability
      scanners exist, some specifically target web applications and web server
      service vulnerabilities and therefore more focused. For example w3af [[w3af]],
      Burp vulnerability scanner [[Burp]], Nikto [[Nikto]], WATOBO [[WATOBO]]
      and others. </p>
      </section>
      </section>

      <section id="exploitation">
	    <h2>Exploitation</h2>

        <p>When a vulnerability or a set of vulnerabilities is found for a component,
        it is important to estimate its exploitation risk level, i.e. if a particular
        vulnerability can be used by an attacker to achieve one of the attack end goals,
        such as privilege escalation, authorization bypass, denial of service and others.
        This step can help to prioritize the order in which vulnerabilities must be fixed,
        by fixing the exploitable vulnerabilities first and then continuing with others.
        Some tools mentioned in section <a href="#protocol-analysis"></a> allows to test
        exploitation of a particular known vulnerability. Additionally, for known
        vulnerabilities, the Exploit-DB [[exploit-db]] database hosts many public exploits
        and allows to search by the CVE number of the vulnerability.
        However, it is important to remember that it is generally very hard to reliably
        determine exploitability of a given vulnerability: if an exploit cannot be
        found, it does not guarantee that vulnerability is not exploitable. Moreover,
        for some vulnerabilities, they might not be exploitable on their own, but play
        an important role in the attacker exploitation chain as a stepping stone towards
        the end exploitation goal. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged to fix all found
        vulnerabilities in the analyzed component.</p>

	    <h1>Suggested Testing Frequency</h1>
        <p> The actual detailed test procedure depends on the type of activity, the WoT
        device setup and the actual test tool used. Below are our recommendations
        for the testing frequency for different testing activities. </p>
        <p>Static Vulnerability Discovery, such as <a href="#static-code-analysis"></a>
        and <a href="#known-vulnerability-checking"></a>, should be done regularly,
        ideally integrated into the development work flow for a WoT component.
        This is important, since any even small code change can introduce
        development mistakes, or alternatively new vulnerabilities in the used
        components appear daily.
        </p>
        <p>Runtime Vulnerability Discovery, such as <a href="#fuzz-testing"></a>
        <a href="#protocol-analysis"></a> and <a href="#vulnerability-scanners"></a>
        should be also done on a regular basis, for example for each major release
        or development milestone.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, <a href="#exploitation"></a> should be done once in a while,
        whenever possible, since it is the most time and resource consuming
        activity that often requires external resources with specialized knowledge.
